# An Archive of the work of Heather Adels

This repository is the backend of a website for an archive of the work of Heather Adels, a Providence, RI visual artist who died in 2017 at the age of 41 of a sudden cardiac arrest.

Many artists, particularly ones as young as Heather was, have no estate plans, wills, or plans to archive their work. But the loss of one artist's work is a loss to all humankind, particularly to current and future artists who benefit from connecting and learning about the art and craft of fellow artists.

This site exists to prevent her art from disappearing from the world.
