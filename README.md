# An Archive of the work of Heather Adels

This repository is the backend of a website for an archive of the work of Heather Adels, a Providence, RI visual artist who died in 2017 at the age of 41 of a sudden cardiac arrest. A remembrance of her is available [here](https://byrslf.co/i-want-to-tell-you-about-heather-732b303759d9).

Many artists, particularly ones as young as Heather was, have no estate plans, wills, or plans to archive their work. But the loss of one artist's work is a loss to all humankind, particularly to current and future artists who benefit from connecting and learning about the art and craft of fellow artists.

This site exists to prevent her art from disappearing from the world.

*Monday, September 11, 2017: This repository and the site it powers are a work in progress. As of today there is a working gallery plugin but only a few photos and no page styling or navigation. More will follow in time. For an idea of the approach, see the Issues tab.*
